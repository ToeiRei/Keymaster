# Keymaster Project TODO List

This file tracks the remaining tasks and potential improvements for the Keymaster project.

## High Priority / Core Logic

## Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Implement Host Key Verification:** The SSH deployer currently uses `InsecureIgnoreHostKey()`. For a production-ready tool, this should be replaced with a proper host key verification strategy, such as checking against a `known_hosts` file.
  - `c:\Users\vbauer\Documents\Keymaster\internal\deploy\ssh.go`

## Completed

- [x] **Implement CLI Commands:** The `deploy`, `rotate-key`, and `audit` commands are now functional.
- [x] **Implement Fleet-Wide Deployment:** The TUI and CLI both support deploying to all active accounts.
